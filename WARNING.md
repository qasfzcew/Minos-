Minos could have pottential serious issues like the installer being unable to upgrade the pc boot config,drivers missing
some system things broken (like restore points) critical services missing and unstabilities, windows updates failure (possibly 
corrupting some systemfiles) missing dependencies on games,programs like a missing dll.
Not recommended for daily use on real hardware until a release is marked as stable.
if somehow you want to try the iso is 100% recommended to use a VM to prevent the lost of data, or further damage.
